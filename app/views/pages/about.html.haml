      %h2 The Way Back to Government for the 100%.
      %p Way Back to Government is a tool to raise awareness and record the cataclysmic changes occurring throughout the U.S.A’s federal government since January 20, 2025 – the day that Donald J. Trump took the oath of office as the 47th President of the United States.
      %p This site collects the personal stories from individuals directly affected by the Trump Administration’s swift actions, which have altered the course of all federal agencies and dozens of domestic and foreign policy fronts. If you have experienced abrupt change in your benefits, employment, or another aspect of your livelihood since President Trump took office, please submit the details here.
      %p By collecting these individual experiences, Way Back to Government aims to memorialize history as it is happening. Like the internet’s Wayback Machine, it will preserve the facts of the people and institutions on which America’s democracy has relied. In this way, the United States cannot ignore or deny the destabilization or extermination of the existing system of government that was designed to work for 100% of Americans.
      %p These collected histories serve as a reference to those government services that – as we are likely to learn the hard way – a stable democracy cannot do without. They will become the beacon guiding us to recollect the institutions of a democratic government that we will need to restore in order to protect open society and prosperous economy for all of us.

      %h2 Who We Are (Not).
      %p We are concerned citizens of the United States.
      %p We are those watching and wondering at the denial of the U.S.’s constitutional order; the dismantling of federal agencies and programs that are pillars of a just society; and the dismissal of those federal employees who have been keeping those pillars upright.
      %p We are ordinary persons in extraordinary times.
      %p We are persons who recognize that others may be anonymous to the news cycle, or even their own representatives in government, but those others have experiences that are too valuable to be lost to history.
      %p We are NOT politicians, political appointees, or a political party of any color.
      %p We are NOT selling goods, services, or an agenda.
      %p We are NOT gathering and harvesting data for some undisclosed purpose or personal gain.

      %h2 Why Way Back to Government and Why Now?
      %p It is too easy in the modern world of fast and unchecked information flows to deny the validity of historical facts. Way Back to Government seeks to capture, in one comprehensive database, the histories of those persons whose lives as they knew it are now a casualty of the sweeping changes from the first weeks of the Trump Administration. By doing so, it creates a record that can be used to raise awareness in the moment, advocate for change in the future, and preserve the lessons of history for posterity.
      %p The radical nature of the immediate actions taken by the incoming Trump Administration across government agencies, and on the economy and foreign policy is undeniable. These actions have, by the Administration’s own admissions, walked the country away from constitutional precedent and disregarded institutional norms in all three branches of governments. Many of us are already asking in these first few weeks of the new presidential term, “We will be able to find our way back?”
      %p “Now” is and will remain the time to gather the facts of what is being imposed upon the public that the news agencies and their information cycles will miss, when recollections are fresh and complete to ensure details are the most accurate. This record will be ongoing as the actions of this Administration are ongoing. It will act as a near-real time “live stream” of the events that we, as Americans, cannot afford to disregard now or deny later.
