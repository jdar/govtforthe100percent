        Government for the 100 Percent is dedicated to increasing transparency in government transitions, ensuring that all Americans—regardless of political affiliation—are protected from illegal maneuvers that distort democracy and create long-term economic inefficiencies.

      %p
        As a new administration takes power, there are laws in place to ensure a smooth and fair transition. But what happens when these laws are ignored? Right now, we are witnessing a systematic effort to entrench one administration’s policy priorities through 
        %strong illegal and unethical
        methods that manipulate government contracts, funding mechanisms, and agency operations.

      %p
        One example: 
        %strong Failing to pay government contractors.
        By deliberately withholding payments, the administration is forcing companies out of business, effectively “freeing up” money to fund its own priorities. This practice is illegal under the 
        %strong Impoundment Act,
        a law explicitly passed by Congress to prevent such abuses of power. And yet, it is happening.

      %p
        This is just one of many ways in which the current transition is being 
        %strong weaponized to undermine the democratic process,
        harming businesses, workers, and communities across the country—including those in states that supported the new administration.
